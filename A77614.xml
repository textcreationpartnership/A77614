            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hriſt, the Scripture, your owne hearts, and Satans Devices, are the foure prime things that ſhould be firſt and moſt ſtudied &amp; ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; if any caſt off the ſtudy of theſe,
<pb facs="tcp:169941:3"/> they cannot be ſafe here, nor hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie<note place="margin">If a Miniſter had as many eyes as <hi>Argus,</hi> to watch; as many heads as <hi>Typheus</hi> to diſpoſe, and as many hands as <hi>Briareus</hi> to labour, he might finde imployment enough for them all.</note> hereafter. 'Tis my worke as a Chriſtian, but much more as I am a <hi>watchman,</hi> to doe my beſt, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the fulneſſe of Chriſt, the emptineſſe of the creature, and the ſnares of the great Deceiver; which I have endeavoured to doe (in the following diſcourſe) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that meaſure of grace, which I have received from the Lord. God once accepted a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of meale for a ſacrifice; and a gripe of Goats haire for an oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and I know that you have not ſo learned the Father, as to deſpiſe the day of ſmall things. Beloved, Satan being fallen from light to darkneſſe, from felicity to miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, from Heaven to hell, from an Angell to a Devill, is ſo full of malice and envy, that he will leave no meanes unattempted, whereby he may make all others eternaly miſerable with himſelfe; he being ſhut out of Heaven, <hi>and ſhut up under chaines of darkneſſe till the judgement of the great day,</hi> makes uſe
<pb facs="tcp:169941:3"/> of all his power and skill, to bring all the ſons of men into the ſame condition, and condemnation with himſelfe. Satan hath caſt ſuch ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeed into our ſoules, that now he can no ſooner tempt, but we are ready to aſſent; he can no ſooner have a plot upon us, but he makes a conqueſt of us; if he doth but ſhew men a little of the beauty, and bravery of the world, how ready are they to fall down, and worſhip him.</p>
            <p>What ever ſin the heart of man is moſt prone to, that the Devill will help forward. If <hi>David</hi> be proud of<note place="margin">2 Sam. 24.</note> his people, Satan wil provoke him to number them, that he may be yet prouder. If <hi>Peter</hi> be ſlaviſhly<note place="margin">Matth. 16. ver. 22. 26. ch. 69. ult.</note> fearfull, Satan will put him upon rebuking and denying of Chriſt, to ſave his owne skin. If <hi>Ahabs</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Kings 22.</note> Prophets be given to flatter, the Devill will ſtrait way <hi>become a lying ſpirit in the mouthes of foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of them,</hi> and they ſhall flatter <hi>Ahab</hi> to his ruine. If <hi>Judas</hi> will<note place="margin">John 13. 2.</note> be a Traitor, Satan will quickly
<pb facs="tcp:169941:4"/> enter into his heart, and make him ſell his Maſter for money, which ſome Heathens would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have done. If <hi>Ananias</hi> will lye<note place="margin">Acts 5. 3.</note> for advantage, <hi>Satan wil fill his heart that he may lye</hi> (with a witneſs) <hi>to the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Satan loves to ſaile with the winde, and to ſuite mens temptations to their conditions, and inclinations; if they be in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, he will tempt them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny God; if they be in adverſity, he will tempt them to diſtruſt<note place="margin">Prov. 30. v. 9.</note> God; if their knowledge be weak, he will tempt them to have low thoughts of God; if their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be tender, he will tempt to ſcrupuloſity; if large, to carnall ſecurity; if we be bold-ſpirited, he will tempt to preſumption; if timerous, to deſperation; if flex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible, to inconſtancie, if ſtiffe, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>From the power, malice, and skill of Satan, doth proceed all the ſoule killing plots, devices, ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems, and machinations, that be in the world; Severall devices
<pb facs="tcp:169941:4"/> he hath to draw ſoules to ſin, and ſeverall plots he hath to keepe ſoules from all holy, and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſervices; and ſeverall ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems he hath, to keep ſoules in a mourning, ſtaggering, doubting, and queſtioning condition. He hath ſeverall devices, to deſtroy the great, and honourable, the wiſe, and learned; the blinde, and ignorant; the rich, and the poore; the reall, and the nominall Saints, &amp;c. One while he will refraine from tempting, that we may think our ſelves ſecure, and neglect our watch; another while he will ſeeme to flie, that he may make us proud of the victory; one while hee will fix mens eyes more on others ſins, then their own, that he may puffe them; another while he will fix their eyes more on others graces then their own, that he may overwhelme them &amp;c. A man may as well tell the ſtars, and number the ſands of the ſea, as reckon up all the devices of Satan; yet thoſe which are moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
<pb facs="tcp:169941:5"/> and by which he doth moſt miſchiefe to the precious ſoules of men, are in the following Treatiſe diſcovered, and the <hi>Remedies</hi> againſt them preſcribed, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Beloved, I think it neceſſary to give you, and the world a faithfull account of the Reaſons, moving me to appear in Print, in theſe dayes, wherein we may ſay there was never more writing, and yet neverleſſe practiſing, and they are theſe that follow, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe Satan hath a<note place="margin">1.

            <p>Your importunity, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity<note place="margin">2. Reaſon.</note> of many other precious ſons of <hi>Zion</hi> hath after much ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with God, my own heart, and others, made a conqueſt of

<pb facs="tcp:169941:6"/> have only toucht upon this ſtring, which hath been no ſmall provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to me, to attempt to doe ſomething this way, that others, that have better heads and hearts, may be the more ſtirred to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their Talents, in a further diſcovery of Satans Devices, and in the making knowne of ſuch choice <hi>Remedies,</hi> as may inable the ſoules of men to triumph over all his plots and ſtratagems, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have many precious friends in<note place="margin">6 Reaſon.</note> ſeverall Countries, who are not a little deſirous, that my pen may reach them, now my voice can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.

            <p>Laſtly, not knowing how ſoon<note place="margin">7. Reaſon.</note> my Glaſſe may be out, and how ſoone I may be cut off by a hand of death, from all opportunities of

That ye may

            <p>My deſires to you are, That you would make it your buſineſſe to ſtudy Chriſt, his Word, your own Hearts, Satans Plots, and Eternity, more then ever; that ye would endeavour more to be inwardly ſincere, then outwardly glorious; to live, then to have a name to live. That yee would labour with all your might, to be thankfull under Mercies, and faithfull in your Places, and humble under Divine Appearances, and fruitfull under

That ye would pray for me, who am not worthy to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med among the Saints, that I may be a precious inſtrument in the hand of Chriſt, to bring in many ſoules unto him, and to build up thoſe that are brought in, in their moſt holy Faith; And that Utterance may be given to me, that I may make knowne all the will of God. That<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.</note> I may be ſincere, faithfull, frequent, fervent, and conſtant in the worke of the Lord, and that my labour be not in vaine in the Lord; That my Labours may be accepted of the Lord, and his Saints, and I may daily ſee the travell of my ſoule, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But above all, pray for me, that I may more and more finde the power, and ſweet of thoſe things upon my owne heart, that I give out to you and others; and that my ſoule be ſo viſited with ſtrength
<pb facs="tcp:169941:9"/> from on high, that I may live up ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and conſtantly to thoſe truths that I hold forth to the world; and that I may be both in Life and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, a burning and a ſhining light; That ſo, when the Lord Jeſus ſhall appear, I may receive a crown of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which he ſhall give to me in that day, and not onely to me, but to all that love his appearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>For a cloſe, remember this, that your life is ſhort, your duties many, your aſſiſtance great, and your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſure; therefore faint not, hold on, and hold up in wayes of well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Heaven ſhall make amends for all.</p>

               <p>The fifth Remedy againſt this Device<note place="margin">5 Remedy.</note> of Satan, is, ſolemnly to conſider, that thoſe that were once glorious on earth, and are now triumphing in Heaven, did look upon the mercy of God, as the moſt powerfull argument to preſerve them from ſin, and to fence their ſouls againſt ſin, and not as an encouragement<note place="margin">Pſal 26. 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> to ſin. <hi>Pſal. 26. 3, 4, 5, 6.

When God had commanded the Jewes to abſtain from <hi>Swines</hi> fleſh, they would not ſo much as name it, but in their common talk would call a <hi>Sow</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing. To abſtain from all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of evill, is to doe nothing wherein ſin appears, or which hath a ſhadow of ſin. <hi>Bernard</hi> gloſſeth finely,<note place="margin">Quicquid eſt male celoratu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> Whatever is of an ill ſhew, or of ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that he may neither wound con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, nor credit; we muſt ſhun, and be ſhie of the very ſhew and ſhadow of ſinne, if either we tender our credit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, or our comfort at home. It was

                  <hi>Auguſtus;</hi> it behoveth thee, not onely not to doe wrong, but not to ſeeeme to doe ſo, &amp;c. So <hi>Jude 23. v.

Under the Law men might not touch a men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous cloath, nor God would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of a ſpotted peace-offering. So we muſt not onely hate, and avoid groſſe ſins, but every thing that may carry a ſavor, or ſuſprition of ſin; we muſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor the very ſignes and tokens of ſin; ſo in <hi>Proverbs 5. ver. 8.

               <p>The ſecond <hi>Remedie</hi> againſt this device<note place="margin">2 Remedy.</note> of Satan is, ſolemnly to conſider, that ordinarily there is no conqueſt over ſin, without the ſoule turnes from the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſin; 'tis impoſſible for that man to get the conqueſt of ſin, that playes and ſports with the occaſions of ſin; God will not remove the tentation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept<note place="margin">The Fable ſaith, that the Butterflie asked the Owle how he ſhould deale with the fire, which had ſinged her wings, who counſel'd her not to behold ſo much as its ſmoak.</note> we turne from the occaſion. It is a juſt and righteous thing with God, that he ſhould fall into the pit, that will adventure to dance upon the brink of the pit; and that he ſhould be a ſlave to ſin, that will not flee from the occaſions of ſin. As long as there is fuell in our hearts for a temptation, we cannot be ſecure; he that hath gun-powder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, had need keep far enough off
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:169941:46"/> from ſparkles; to ruſh upon the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of ſin, is both to tempt our ſelves, and to tempt Satan to tempt our ſouls; 'tis very rare that any ſoule playes with occaſions of ſin, but that ſoul is inſnar'd by ſin; 'tis ſeldome that God keeps that ſoul from the acts of ſin, that will not keep off from the occaſions of ſin; he that adventures upon the occaſions of ſin, is as he that would quench the fire with Oyle, which is a fuell to maintaine it; and increaſe it. Ah ſouls! often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, how frequently you have been overcome by ſin, when you have boldly gon upon the occaſions of ſin; look back ſouls, to the days of your vanity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you have been as eaſily conquered, as tempted, vanquiſhed, as aſſaulted, when you have played with the occaſions of ſin; and therefore, as you would for the future be kept from the acting of ſin, and be made victorious over ſin, oh flee from the occaſions of ſin.</p>
               <p>The third Remedy againſt this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice<note place="margin">3 Remedy.</note> of Satan, is ſeriouſly to conſider, that other precious Saints that were once glorious on earth, and are now triumphing in heaven, have turned from the occaſions of ſin, as Hell it ſelfe; as you may ſee in <hi>Joſeph, Gen. 39. 10. And it came to paſſe, as ſhe ſpake to Joſeph day by day, that he hearkned not unto her, to lye by
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:169941:47"/> her, or to be with her. Joſeph</hi> was famous for all the four Cardinall vertues; if ever any were in this one temptation, you may ſee his Fortitude, Juſtice, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,<note place="margin">There are ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, that would not look upon excellent beauties, leſt they ſhould be inſnared.</note> and Prudence, in that he ſhuns the occaſion (for he would not ſo much as be with her) and that a man is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that he is in a temptation, which is but a tap to give vent to corruption. The <hi>Nazarite</hi> might not only not drink wine, but not taſte a grape, or the husk of a grape. The <hi>Leaper</hi> was to ſhave his haire, and paire his nailes. The Devill counts a fit occaſion, halfe a conqueſt; for he knowes that corrupt nature hath<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Democritus</hi> pluck't out his own eyes, to avoid the danger of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe.</note> a ſeed-plot of all ſin, which being drawn forth, and watered by ſome ſinfull oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, is ſoon ſet a work to the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of death and deſtruction; God will not remove the temptation, till we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the occaſion. A Bird whiles a loft, is ſafe, but ſhe comes not near the ſnare without danger; the ſhunning the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of ſin renders a man moſt like the beſt of men; a ſoul eminently gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, dares not come near the traine, though he be far off the blow. So <hi>Job 31. 1. I made a Covenant with mine eyes,</hi>

                     </gap> I cut a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; In ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, it was a cuſtome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jewes, to cut ſome beaſt or other in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to walk between the pieces, to ſignifie, that they deſired God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them that ſhould break the Covenant.</note> 
                  <hi>why then ſhould I think upon a maid?</hi> I ſet a watch at the entrance of my ſenſes, that my foul might not by them be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and endangered; the eye is the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:169941:47"/> window of the ſoule, and if that ſhould be alwayes open, the ſoul might ſmart for it. A man may not look intently upon that, that he may nat love intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The Diſciples were ſet a gogg, by beholding the beauty of the Temple; 'tis beſt and ſafeſt to have the eye alwayes fixt upon the higheſt and nobleſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; as the Marriners eye is fixt on the ſtar, when their hand is on the ſterne: ſo <hi>David,</hi> when he was himſelf, he ſhuns the occaſion of ſin, <hi>Pſal. 26. 4, 5. I have not ſat with vaine perſons, neither will I goe in with diſſemblers; I have hated the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of evill doers, and will not ſit with the wicked.</hi> Stories ſpeak of ſome that could not ſleep, when they thought of the Trophies of other Worthies, that went before them; the higheſt and choy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt examples are to ſome, and ſhould be to all very quickning and provoking; and oh! that the examples of thoſe worthy Saints, <hi>David, Joſeph,</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> might prevaile with all your ſouls to ſhun and avoid the occaſions of ſin; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one ſhould ſtrive to be like to them in grace, that they deſire to be equall with in glory. He that ſhooteth at the Sun, though he come far ſhort, will ſhoot higher, then he that aimeth at a ſhrub; 'tis beſt (and it ſpeaks out much of Chriſt within) to eye the higheſt,

               <p>The fourth Remedy againſt this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice<note place="margin">4 Remedy.</note> of Satan, is, ſolemnly to conſider, that the avoiding the occaſions of ſin, is an evidence of grace, and that which lifts up a man above moſt other men in the world; that a man is indeed, which he is in temptation; and when ſinfull occaſions doe preſent themſelves before the ſoul, this ſpeaks out both the truth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaith of <hi>Demoſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> that he was excellent at praiſing the worthy acts of his Anceſtors, but not ſo at imitating them, oh that this were not applicable to many profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors in our times.</note> and the ſtrength of grace; when with <hi>Lot,</hi> a man can be chaſt in <hi>Sodome,</hi> and with <hi>Timothy</hi> can live temperately in <hi>Aſia,</hi> among the luxurious <hi>Epheſians;</hi> and with <hi>Job</hi> can walk uprightly in the land of <hi>

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:169941:48"/> but grace can fence a man againſt the occaſions of ſin, when he is ſtrongly tempted thereunto; therefore as you would cherriſh a precious evidence in your own boſomes, of the truth and ſtrength of your graces, ſhun all ſinfull occaſions.</p>

               <p>THe firſt Remedy is, ſolemnly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,<note place="margin">1 Remedy.</note> that no man knowes how the heart of God ſtands by his hand, his hand of mercy may be towards a man, when his heart may be ſet againſt that man; as you may ſee in <hi>Saul,</hi> and<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tully</hi> judged the Jews Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to be naught, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were ſo often overcome, &amp; impoveriſh'd, and afflicted; and the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of <hi>Rome</hi> to be right, becauſe the <hi>Romans</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered, and became Lords of the world; &amp; yet though the Romans had his hand, the Jews had his heart; for they were dearly belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, though ſorely afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> others; and the hand of God may be ſet againſt a man, when the heart of God is dearly ſet upon a man, as you may ſee in <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Ephraim;</hi> the hand of God was ſorely ſet againſt them, and yet the heart and bowels of God were ſtrongly working towards them; no man knoweth either love or hatred, by outward mercy or miſery; for all things come alike to all, to the righteous, and to the unrighteous; to the good, and to the bad, to the clean, and to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ſun of proſperity ſhines as well upon brambles of the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as fruit-trees of the Orchard; the ſnow and haile of adverſity lights upon the beſt gardens, as well as the ſtinking dunghills, or the wild waſte. <hi>Ahabs</hi> and <hi>Joſiah's</hi> ends concur in the very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan,</hi> though dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in their natures, deſerts, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:169941:50"/> yet in their deaths they were not divided. Health, wealth, honours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> croſſes, ſickneſſes, loſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are caſt upon good men, and bad men promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly. The whole Turkiſh Empire is<note place="margin">

               <p>The ſecond Remedy againſt this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice<note place="margin">2 Remedy.</note> of Satan, is, ſeriouſly to conſider, That there is nothing in the world that doth ſo provoke God to be wrath, and angry, as mens taking incouragement from Gods goodneſſe, and mercy, to do wickedly; this you may ſee by that wrath that fell upon the old world, and by Gods raining hell out of Heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">Such ſoules make God a God of <hi>clouts,</hi> one that will not doe as he ſaith, but they ſhall find God to be as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, as he is to others gracious in pardoning. Good turnes aggravate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſſes, and our guilt is increaſed by our obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.</note> 
                  <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorah.</hi> This is clear in that 44 of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> from the 20 <hi>verſe,</hi> to the 28 <hi>verſe,</hi> the words are worthy of your beſt meditation; oh that they were engraven in all your hearts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in all your thoughts! though they are too large for me to tranſcribe them, yet they are not too large for you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:169941:50"/> them: To argue from mercy to ſinfull liberty, is the Devils Logick, and ſuch Logicians doe ever walk, as upon a mine of Gun-powder, ready to be blown up; no ſuch ſouls can ever avert, or avoid the wrath of God. This is wickedneſſe at the height, for a man to be very bad, becauſe God is very good, a worſe ſpirit then this is not in hell; ah Lord! doth not wrath, yea the greateſt wrath, lie at this mans door? Are not the ſtrongeſt chaines of darknes prepared for ſuch a ſoul? To ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt mercy, is to ſin againſt humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it is beſtiall, nay it is worſe. To ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der good for evill, is Divine, to render good for good, is humane, to render evill for evill, is brutiſh; but to render evill for good, is deviliſh; and from this evill deliver my ſoul oh God.</p>
               <p>The third Remedy againſt this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice<note place="margin">3 Remdy.</note> of Satan, is, ſolemnly to conſider, that there is no greater miſery in this life, then not to be in miſery; no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Religio peperit divitias &amp; filia devoravit matrem.</hi> Religion brought forth Riches, and the daughter ſoon devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaith <hi>Auguſtine.</hi>
                  </note> affliction, then not to be afflicted; woe, woe to that ſoul that God will not ſpend a rod upon; this is the ſaddeſt ſtroke of all, when God refuſes to ſtrike at all. <hi>Ephraim is joyned to Idols, let him alone. Why ſhould you be ſmitten any more, you will revolt more and more.</hi> When the Phyſician gives over the Patient, you ſay
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:169941:51"/> ring out his knell, the man is dead: ſo when God gives over a ſoul to ſin, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controule, you may truly ſay, this ſoule is loſt; you may ring out his knel, for he is twice dead, and pluckt up by the roots. Freedome from puniſhment is the mother of ſecurity, the ſtep-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of virtue, the poyſon of Religion, the moth of holineſſe, and the introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of wickedneſſe; nothing ſaid one, ſeemes more unhappy to me, then he to whom no adverſity hath happened. Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mercies oft-times prove a ſnare to our ſoules. <hi>I will lay a ſtumbling block, Ezek. 3. 20. Vatablus</hi> his note there is<note place="margin">Faciam, ut om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia habeant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpera; calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatibus eum à peccato non re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocabo.</note> I will proſper him in all things, and not by affliction, reſtraine him from ſin. Proſperity hath been a ſtumbling block, at which millions have ſtumbled, and fallen, and broke the neck of their ſouls for ever.</p>
               <p>The fourth <hi>Remedie</hi> againſt this device<note place="margin">4 Remedy.</note> of Satan, is ſeriouſly to conſider, that the wants of wicked men under all their outward mercy, &amp; freedom from adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, is far greater then al their outward injoyments. They have many mercies, yet they want more then they injoy; the mercies which they injoy are nothing to the mercies they want; 'Tis true, they have honors, and riches, and pleaſures and friends, and are mighty in power,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:169941:51"/> their ſeed is eſtabliſhed in their ſight with them, and their off-ſpring before their eyes; their houſes are ſafe from feare, neither is the rod of God upon them; <hi>They ſend forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance. They take the Timbrell and Harp, and rejoyce at the</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>ſound of the Organ; they ſpend their dayes in wealth, their eyes ſtand out with fatneſſe, they have more then heart can wiſh: And they have no bands in their death, but their ſtrength is firme; They are not in trouble as other men;</hi> as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> ſpeak; yet all this is nothing to what they want; they want intereſt in God, Chriſt, the Spirit, the Promiſes, the Covenant of Grace, and everlaſting Glory. They want acceptation and reconciliation with God; They want Righteouſneſſe, Juſtification, Sanctification, Adoption, and Redemption. They want the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin, and power againſt ſin, and freedome from the dominion of ſin: They want that favour that is better then life, and that joy that is unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and full of glory; and that peace that paſſes underſtanding; and that<note place="margin">

They want a Houſe that hath foundations, whoſe builder and maker is God; they want thoſe riches that periſh not; that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:169941:52"/> glory that fades not, that Kingdome that ſhakes not.

Where is the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God? Where are the comforts of the holy Ghoſt? Where are thy evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences for Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> This word from Conſcience makes the mans coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to change, his thoughts to be troubled, his heart to be amazed, and all his mercies on the right hand, and left, to be as dead and withered. Ah! were but the eyes of wicked men open to ſee their wants, under their abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, they would cry out, and ſay as <hi>Abſalom</hi> did, <hi>What are all theſe to me, ſo long as I cannot ſee the Kings face?</hi> What's honour, and riches, and the favour of Creatures, ſo long as I want the favour of God, the pardon of my ſins, an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtin Chriſt, and the hopes of glory.

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:169941:52"/> me theſe, or elſe I ſhall eternally dye.</p>
               <p>The fift Remedy againſt this Device<note place="margin">5 Remedy.</note> of Satan, is, ſolemnly to confider, that outward things are not as they ſeem, and are eſteemed; they have indeed a glorious outſide, but if you view their inſides, you will eaſily find that they fill the head full of cares, and the heart full of feares; what if the fire ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume one part of my eſtate, and the ſea ſhould be a grave to ſwallow up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of my eſtate; what if my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſhould be unfaithfull abroad, and my children ſhould be deceitful at home? ah the ſecret fretting, vexing, and gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that doth daily, yea hourly, attend thoſe mens ſouls, whoſe hands are full of worldly goods. 'Twas a good ſpeech of an Emperour, you (ſaid he) gaze on my purple Robe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is not what men injoy, but the principle from whence it comes, that makes men happy; much of theſe outward things doe uſually cauſe great diſtraction, great vexation, and great condemnation at laſt, to the poſeſſors of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:169941:53"/> them; if God gives them in his wrath, &amp; do not ſanctifie them in his love, they will at laſt be witneſſes againſt a man, and racks to torture and torment a man, and milſtones for ever to ſink a man, in that day, when God ſhall call men to an account, not for the uſe, but for the abuſe of mercy.</p>

               <p>The fourth Remedy againſt this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:169941:61"/> of Satan, is, ſeriouſly to confider, that the afflictions that doe befall the Saints, are ſuch as proceed from Gods deareſt love. <hi>As many as I love I rebuke</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Auſtine</hi> asketh (<hi>Si amatur quomedo infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matur</hi>) if he were belov'd, how came he to be ſick? So are wicked men apt to ſay, becauſe they know not that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections are pledges of our adoption, and badges of our Son ſhip. God had one Son without ſin, but none without ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</note> 
                  <hi>and chaſten;</hi> be zealous therefore, and repent. Saints ſaith God, think not that I hate you, becauſe I thus chide you; he that eſcapes reprehenſion, may ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his adoption; God had one Son without corruption, but no Son with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out correction. A gracious ſoule may look through the darkeſt cloud, and ſee a God ſmiling on him. We muſt look through the anger of his correction, to the ſweetneſſe of his countenance, and as by a Rain-bow, we ſee the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full image of the Suns light, in the midſt of a dark, and wateriſh cloud. When <hi>Munſter</hi> lay ſick, and his friends asked him how he did, and how he felt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, he pointed to his ſores and ulcers (whereof he was full) and ſaid, theſe are Gods Gems, and Jewells, wherewith he decketh his beſt friends, and to me they are more precious then all the gold and ſilver in the world. A ſoul at firſt converſion is but ruf caſt, but God by afflictions doth ſquare and fit, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion it for that glory above, which doth ſpeak them out, to flow from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious love; therefore the afflictions that doe attend the people of God, ſhould be
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:169941:61"/> no bar to holineſſe, nor no motive to draw the ſoul to wayes of wickedneſſe.</p>
               <p>The fift Remedy againſt this Device<note place="margin">5 Remedy.</note> of Satan, is, ſolemnly to conſider, that 'tis our duty, and glory, not to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure afflictions by the ſmart, but by the end. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> was diſmiſled out of<note place="margin">Exod. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Aegypt,</hi> 'twas with <hi>gold,</hi> and <hi>ear-rings.</hi> So the <hi>Jewes</hi> were diſmiſſed out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> with <hi>gifts, jewels,</hi> and all neceſſary <hi>uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils.</hi> Look more at the latter end of a<note place="margin">Ezra 1.</note> Chriſtian, then the beginning of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction; conſider the patience of <hi>Job,</hi> and what end the Lord made with him.

Afflictions they are but as a dark entry into your Fathers houſe, they are but as a dirty lane to a

Now tell me ſoules, whether it be not very great mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to ſhun the wayes of holineſſe, and to walke in the wayes of wickedneſſe, becauſe of thoſe afflictions that doe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the wayes of holineſſe.</p>
               <p>The ſixt <hi>Remedy</hi> againſt this device of Satan, is ſeriouſly to conſider, that the deſigne of God in all the afflictions that do befall them, is only to try them; 'tis not to wrong them, nor to ruine them, as ignorant ſoules are apt to think. <hi>He knoweth the way that I take, and when he hath tryed me, I ſhall come forth as gold,</hi> ſaith patient <hi>Job</hi> So in that 8. <hi>Dan. 2.

                  <hi>wouldeſt keep his Commandements or no.</hi> God afflicted them thus, that he might make known to themſelves, and others, what was in their hearts. When fire is put to green wood, there comes out abundance of watery ſtuffe that afore appeared not; when the pond is emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the mud, filth, and toads come to light. The ſnow covers many a dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill; ſo doth proſperity many a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten heart. It is eaſie to wade in a warme-bath, and every bird can ſing

So the Lord many times breaks our bones, but 'tis in order to the ſaving of our lives, and our ſoules for ever; he gives us a poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that makes us heart-ſick, but 'tis in order to the making us perfectly well, and to the purging of us from thoſe ill humours, that have made our heads ake, and Gods heart ake, and our ſouls ſick, and heavy to the death, &amp;c.

               <p>The ſecond <hi>Remedie</hi> againſt this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice<note place="margin">2 Remedy.</note> of Satan, is, ſolemnly to conſider, that the Lord Jeſus will make his ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces eaſie to you, by the ſweet diſcovery of himſelfe to your ſoules, whilſt you are in his ſervice. <hi>Thou meeteſt him that rejoyceth, and worketh righteouſneſſe, thoſe that remember thee in thy wayes,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith; if meeting with<note place="margin">

Remember this, that God will ſuit your ſtrength to your worke, and in the hardeſt ſervice you ſhall have the choiſeſt aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>The third <hi>Remedie</hi> againſt this device of Satan, is, to dwel upon the hard and difficult things that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath paſt through, for your tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, ſpirituall, and eternall good. Ah! what a ſea of blood? a ſea of wrath? of ſinne, of ſorrow, and miſery did the Lord Jeſus wade through, for your internal and eternall good? Chriſt did not plead, this Croſſe is too heavy for me to beare, this wrath is too great
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:169941:89"/> for me to lie under, this Cup (which hath in it all the ingredients of divine diſpleaſure) is too bitter for me to ſip off, how much more to drink the very dregs of it? no, Chriſt ſtands not upon this; he pleads not the difficulty of the ſervice, but reſolutely, and bravely wades through all, as the Prophet <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa</hi> ſhews: <hi>The Lord God hath opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back. I gave my back to the ſmiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the haire; I hid not my face from ſhame and ſpitting.</hi> Chriſt makes nothing of his Fathers wrath, the burden of your ſins, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice<note place="margin">

Ah ſoules! if this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration will not raiſe up your ſpirits, above all the diſcouragements that you meet with, to owne Chriſt and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and to ſtick, and cleave to Chriſt, and his ſervice; I am afraid nothing will. A ſoule not ſtir'd by this, not rais'd, and lifted up by this, to be reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and brave in the ſervice of God, notwithſtanding all dangers and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, is a ſoule left of God to much blindneſſe, and hardneſſe.</p>
               <p>The 4. <hi>Remedy</hi> againſt this Device of<note place="margin">4. Remedie.</note> Satan, is, to conſider, that religious duties, holy and heavenly exerciſes are

               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:169941:90"/>
               <p>The fifth <hi>Remedy</hi> againſt this Device<note place="margin">5 Remedie.</note> of Satan, is, ſolemnly to conſider, that great reward, and glorious recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence that doth attend thoſe that cleave to the ſervice of the Lord, in the<note place="margin">

               <p>Chriſtians that would hold on in the ſervice of the Lord, muſt look more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Crown, then upon the Croſſe; more upon their future glory, then their preſent miſery; more upon their incouragements, then upon their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements.

               <p>The fourth <hi>Remedy</hi> againſt this device<note place="margin">4. Remedy.</note> of Satan, is, ſeriouſly to conſider this,

'Tis ſafeſt, and ſweeteſt to define as God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines, both vices and graces; this is the only way to ſettle the ſoule, and to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it againſt all the wiles of men and devills, who labour by falſe definitions of grace to keepe precious ſoules in a doubting, ſtaggering, and languiſhing condition, and ſo make their lives a burden, a hell unto them.</p>
               <p>The third <hi>Remedie</hi> againſt this device<note place="margin">3 Remedie.</note> of Satan, is, ſeriouſly to conſider this, that there may be true faith, where there<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 30. chap. 14. 31. &amp; chap. 16. 8.</note> is much doubtings; witneſſe thoſe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſayings of Chriſt to his Diſciples, <hi>Why are yee afraid oh yee of little faith?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 12. 28.</note> Perſons may be truly believing, who nevertheleſſe are ſometimes doubting; in the ſame perſons (that the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Scriptures ſpeak of) you may ſee their faith commended, and their doubts condemned, which doth neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſuppoſe a preſence of both.</p>
               <p>The fourth <hi>Remedie</hi> againſt this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice<note place="margin">4 Remedy.</note> of Satan, is, ſolemnly to conſider,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:169941:116"/> that aſſurance is an effect of faith; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot be faith. The cauſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the effect, nor the root the fruit; as the effect ſlowes from the cauſe, the fruit from the root, the ſtream from the fountain, ſo doth the aſſurance flow from faith; this truth I ſhall make good thus.</p>
               <p>The aſſurance of our ſalvation, and pardon of ſin doth primarily ariſe from the witneſſe of the ſpirit of God, that<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1. 13. Gal. 5. 6.</note> we are the children of God: And the ſpirit never witneſſeth this, till we are beleevers; <hi>for we are ſonnes by faith in</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 4 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> therefore aſſurance is not faith, but followes it, as the effect fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the cauſe.</p>
               <p>Againe, no man can be aſſured, and perſwaded of his ſalvation, till he be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to Chriſt, till he be ingrafted into Chriſt; and a man cannot be ingrafted into Chriſt, till he hath faith; hee muſt firſt be ingrafted into Chriſt by faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can have aſſurance of his ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which doth clearly evidence, that aſſurance is not faith, but an effect and fruit of faith, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Again, faith cannot be loſt, but aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance may; therefore aſſurance is not faith. Though aſſurance be a precious<note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 12. Pſal. 30. 6, 7.</note> flower in the garden of a Saint, and is more infinitely ſweet, and delightful to
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:169941:116"/> the ſoule, then all outward comforts,<note place="margin">Cant. 5. 6. Iſa. 8. 17.</note> and contents; yet 'tis but a flower that is ſubject to fade, and to looſe its freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,<note place="margin">There is many thouſand pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſouls, of whom this world is not worthy, that have the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Againe, a man muſt firſt have faith, before he can have aſſurance, therefore aſſurance is not faith; and that a man muſt firſt have faith, before he can have aſſurance, is cleare; by this a man muſt firſt be ſaved, before he can be aſſured of his ſalvation, for he cannot be aſſured of that which is not; and a man muſt firſt have a ſaving faith, before he can be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by faith; for he cannot be ſaved by that which he hath not; therefore a man muſt firſt have faith, before he can have aſſurance, and ſo it roundly followes, that aſſurance is not faith, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>THe firſt <hi>Remedie</hi> againſt this device<note place="margin">1 Remedie.</note> of Satan, is, ſolemnly to conſider that many things may be croſſe to our deſires, that are not croſſe to our good; <hi>Abraham, Jacob, David, Job, Moſes, Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellians</hi> being not able to withſtand the preaching, &amp; writing of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> ſought his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving beſet the way he was to goe his viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but by Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, he miſſing his way, eſcaped the danger.</note> 
                  <hi>Jonah, Paul, &amp;c.</hi> met with many things that were contrary to their de fires, and endeavours, that were not contrary to their good, as all know, that have wiſely compared their deſires and endeavours, and Gods actings toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Phyſick often works contrary to the Patients deſires, when it doth not work contrary to their good. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member a ſtory of a godly man, who had a great deſire to goe to <hi>France,</hi> and as he was going to take ſhipping, he broke his leg, and it pleaſed providence ſo to order it, that the ſhip that he ſhould have gone in, at that very ſame time was
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:169941:117"/> caſt away, and not a man ſaved, and ſo by breaking a bone, his life was ſaved. Though Providence did worke croſſe to his deſires, yet it did not work croſs to his good, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The ſecond <hi>Remedie</hi> againſt this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice<note place="margin">2 Remedy.</note> of Satan, is, ſolemnly to conſider, that the hand of God may be againſt a man, when the love and heart of God is much ſet upon a man; No man can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude how the heart of God ſtands by his hand. The hand of God was againſt <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and yet his love, his heart was<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 18, 19, 20. Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiall hand may be with perſons, when his heart is ſet againſt them; Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiall hand was for a time with <hi>Saul, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Aſhur,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iehu,</hi> and yet his heart was ſet againſt them. No man knoweth love or hatred by all that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. <hi>Eccleſ. 9. 1, 2.</hi>
                  </note> dearly ſet upon <hi>Ephraim. I have ſurely heard Ephraim bemoaning himſelfe thus; thou haſt chaſtiſed mee, and I was chaſtiſed as a bullocke unaccuſtomed to the yoke: turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned, for thou art the Lord my God. Surely after that I was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I repented; and after that I was inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, I ſmote upon my thigh; I was aſhamed, yea, even confounded, becauſe I did beare the reproach of my youth. Ephraim is my deare ſonne, he is a pleaſant child; for ſince I ſpake againſt him, I doe earneſtly remember him ſtill: therefore my bowells are troubled for him, I will ſurely have mercy upon him, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God can look ſowrly, and chide bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, and ſtrike heavily, even where, and when he loves dearly. The hand of God was very much againſt <hi>Job,</hi> and yet
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:169941:118"/> his love, his heart was very much ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Job,</hi> as you may ſee by comparing the 2. firſt chap. of <hi>Iob</hi> with the two laſt. The hand of God was ſore againſt <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and <hi>Jonah,</hi> when his heart was much ſet upon them. He that ſhall conclude, that the heart of God is againſt thoſe that his hand is againſt, will condemne the generation of the juſt, whom God unjuſtly would not have condemned.</p>
               <p>The third <hi>Remedie</hi> againſt this device<note place="margin">3 Remedie.</note> of Satan, is, to conſider, that all the croſſe providences that befall the Saints, are but in order to ſome noble good, that God doth intend to conferre upon them. Providence wrote croſſe to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> deſire, in taking away the child ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully begotten, but yet not croſſe to a more noble good; for was it not farre better for <hi>David</hi> to have ſuch a legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Heire as <hi>Solomon</hi> was, then that a Baſtard ſhould weare the Crown, and ſway the Scepter?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joſeph</hi> you know, was ſold into a far Country by the envy and malice of his brethren, and afterwards impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe he would not be a priſoner to his <hi>Miſtriſſes</hi> luſts; yet all theſe croſs providences did wonderfully conduce to his advancement, and the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Fathers family, which was then the viſible Church of Chriſt. It was ſo
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:169941:118"/> ordered by a noble hand of providence, that what they ſought to decline, they did promote; <hi>Joſeph</hi> was therefore ſold by his brethren, that he might not be worſhipped, and yet he was therefore worſhipped, becauſe he was ſold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> was deſigned to a Kingdome; but oh the ſtraits, troubles, and deaths, that he run through, before he feels the weight of the Crown; and all this was but in order to the ſweetning of his Crown, and to the ſetling of it more firmly and gloriouſly upon his head; God did ſo contrive it, that <hi>Jonah's</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and thoſe croſſe actings of his that did attend it, ſhould advantage that end which they ſeemed moſt dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly<note place="margin">The motions of divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence are ſo dark, ſo deep, ſo changea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the wiſeſt and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt ſoules cannot tell what conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to make.</note> to oppoſe; <hi>Jonah</hi> he flies to <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiſh,</hi> then caſt into the Sea, then ſaved by a miracle: Then the Marriners, as is very probable, who caſt <hi>Jonah</hi> into the Sea, declared to the <hi>Ninivites</hi> what had hapned; therefore he muſt be a man ſent of God, and that his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings muſt be beleeved, and hearkned to, and therefore they muſt repent, and humble themſelves, that the wrath threatned might not be executed, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The fourth <hi>Remedy</hi> againſt this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice<note place="margin">4 Remedie.</note> of Satan, is, ſeriouſly to conſider, that all the ſtrange, dark, deep, and changeable providences that Believers
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:169941:119"/> meet with, ſhall further them in their way to heaven, in their journey to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe; divine wiſdome and love will ſo order all things here below, that they ſhall work for the reall, internall, and eternall good of them that love him. All the rugged providences that <hi>David</hi> met with, did contribute to the<note place="margin">

As the waters lifted up <hi>Noah's</hi> Ark nearer Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: and as all the ſtones that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Stevens</hi> eares, did but knock him the cloſer to Chriſt, the corner-ſtone, ſo all the ſtrange rugged providences that we meet with, they ſhall raiſe us nearer Heaven, and knock us neerer to Chriſt, that precious corner-ſtone, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>THe firſt <hi>Remedie</hi> againſt this device of Satan, is, ſeriouſly to conſider, that grace is taken two wayes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, 'tis taken for the gracious good will and favour of God, whereby he is pleaſed of his owne free love, to accept of ſome in Chriſt for his owne. This ſome call the firſt grace, becauſe 'tis the fountaine of all other graces, and the Spring from whence they flow; and it's therefore called grace, becauſe it makes a man gracious with God, but this is only in God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, grace is taken for the gifts of grace, and they are of two ſorts, common, or ſpecial.</p>
               <p>Some are common to Beleevers, and hypocrites, as a gift of knowledge, a gift of prayer, &amp;c.<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 22, 23.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Some are ſpecial graces, and they are proper, and peculiar to the Saints, as faith, humility, meekneſſe, love, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The ſecond <hi>Remedie</hi> againſt this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice<note place="margin">2 Remedie.</note> of Satan, is, wiſely to conſider the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:169941:120"/> differences betwixt renuing grace, and<note place="margin">God brings not a paire of ſcales to weigh our graces, but a touch-ſtone to try our graces.

True grace changes the very nature of a man, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vertue doth only reſtrain, or chain up the outward man; it doth not change the whole man; a Lion in a

                  <hi>Lord, and I will not keep anger for ever. Turne, oh backsliding Iſrael, ſaith the Lord, for I am married unto you: And I will take you one of a City, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion:</hi> So the Pſalmiſt, <hi>They turned back and dealt unfaithfully like their Fathers, they were turned aſide like a deceitfull bow.</hi> And no wonder, for tho their repentance be never ſo ſincere and ſound, yet their graces are but weak,

               <p>The ſecond Remedy againſt this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice<note place="margin">2 Remedie.</note> of Satan, is ſeriouſly to conſider, that God hath no where ingaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by any particular promiſe, that ſoules converted and united to Chriſt, ſhall not fall againe and againe into the ſame ſins after converſion.

               <p>The ſecond Remedy againſt this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice<note place="margin">2 Remedie.</note> of Satan, is, ſolemnly to conſider, that mens leaning and truſting to their own wits, parts, and abilities, have been their utter overthrow, and ruine;<note place="margin">General coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels were ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, becauſe men came with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their owne under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and ſeeking for vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory rather then verity, ſaith one.</note> as you may ſee in <hi>Achitophel,</hi> and thoſe Preſidents and Princes that engaged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Daniel,</hi> and in the Scribes and Phariſees; God loves to confute men in their Confidences; he that ſtands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his parts and abilities, doth but ſtand upon a quick-ſand, that will certainly faile him. There is nothing in the world that provokes God more to with-draw from the ſoul, then this, and how can the ſoul ſtand when his ſtrength is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from him? Every thing that a man leanes upon, but God, will be a dart that will certainly pierce his heart through and through; ah! how many in theſe dayes have loſt their eſtates? their friends? their lives? their ſouls? by leaning upon their admired parts and abilities? The Saints are deſcribed<note place="margin">Cant. 8. 5.</note> by their leaning upon their beloved the Lord Jeſus; he that leanes onely upon the boſome of Chriſt, lives the higheſt, choyceſt, ſafeſt, and ſweeteſt life; miſeries alwayes lye at that mans doore, that leans upon any thing below the precious boſome of Chriſt. Such a man is moſt in danger, and this is none
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:169941:154"/> of his leaſt plagues, that he thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſecure. 'Tis the greateſt wiſdome in the world, to take the wiſe mans counſell. <hi>Truſt in the Lord with all thy</hi>

In the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times it was much taken notice of by the Heathens, that in the depth of miſery, when fathers and mothers forſook their children, Chriſtians (o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:169941:159"/> ſtrangers) ſtuck one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whoſe love of Religion proved firmer then that of nature.

               <p>The fourth <hi>Remedie</hi> againſt this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice<note place="margin">4 Remedy.</note> of Satan, is, to dwell more upon thoſe choice and ſweet things, wherein you agree, then upon thoſe things wherein you differ; ah! did you but thus, how would ſinfull heats be aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and your love raiſed, and your ſpirits ſweetned one to another; you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in moſt, you differ but in a few; you agree in the greateſt, and weightieſt; as concerning God, Chriſt, the ſpirit, the Scripture, &amp;c. you differ only in thoſe points that have been long diſputable amongſt men of greateſt piety, and parts; you agree to own the Scripture, to hold to Chriſt the Head, and to walk<note place="margin">What a ſad thing was it that a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then ſhould ſay, No beaſts are ſo miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous to men, as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are one to another.</note> according to the lawes of the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

               <p>The fifth <hi>Remedie</hi> againſt this Device<note place="margin">5 Remedie.</note> of Satan, is, ſolemnly to conſider, that God delights to be ſtiled <hi>(Deus pacis) the God of peace;</hi> and Chriſt to be ſtiled<note place="margin">

Oh! why then ſhould not the Saints be children of peace? Certainely men of froward, unquiet, fiery ſpirits cannot have that ſweet evidence of their intereſt in the God of Peace, and in the Prince of Peace, and in the ſpirit of Peace, as thoſe precious ſouls have that follow after the things that make for love and peace. The very name of peace<note place="margin">

The Ancients were wont to paint Peace in the form of a Woman, with a horne of plenty in her hand. Ah! peace and love among the Saints is that which will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them, and their mercies at home; yea, it will multiply their mercies, it wil engage the God of mercy to crown them with the choiceſt mercies, and 'tis
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:169941:160"/> that will render them moſt terrible, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible, and ſucceſſefull abroad; love and peace among the Saints, is that which puts the counſells of their Enemies to a ſtand, and renders all their enterprizes abortive; 'tis that which doth moſt weaken their hands, wound their hopes, and kill their hearts, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The ſixth <hi>Remedie</hi> againſt this Device<note place="margin">6 Remedie.</note> of Satan, is, to make more care and conſcience of keeping up your peace<note place="margin">There is no fear of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much, but there is much feare in practiſing too little.</note> with God; ah Chriſtians!

An humble heart is a habitation for God, a ſcholar<note place="margin">Humility is (<hi>conſervatrix vir virtutum</hi>) ſaith <hi>Bernard,</hi> that which keeps all gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces together.</note> for Chriſt, a companion for Angels, a preſerver of grace, and a fitter for glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Humility is the nurſe of our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the preſerver of our mercies, and the great promoter of holy duties. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility cannot finde three things on this ſide Heaven; it cannot find <hi>fulneſſe in the creature,</hi> nor <hi>ſweetneſſe in ſinne,</hi> nor <hi>life in an Ordinance without Chriſt.</hi> An humble ſoule always finds three things on this ſide Heaven; <hi>the ſoule to be empty, Chriſt to be full, and every mercy and duty to be ſweet, wherein God is injoyed.</hi> Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility can weep over other mens weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and joy, and rejoyce over their graces. Humility will make a man<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 1. 2, 3.</note> quiet, and contented in the meaneſt
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:169941:166"/> condition, and 'twill preſerve a man from envying others proſperous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Humility honours thoſe that are ſtrong in grace, and puts two hands<note place="margin">Epheſ. 3. 8.</note> under thoſe that are weak in grace. Humility makes a man richer then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, and it makes a man judge himſelfe the pooreſt among men. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility will ſee much good abroad, when it can ſee but little at home; Ah Chriſtians! though faith be the champion of grace, and love thee nurſe of grace, yet humility is the beautifier of grace; it caſts a generall glory upon all the graces in the ſoule; ah! did Chriſtians more abound in humility,<note place="margin">The humble ſoul is like the violet, which grows low, hangs the head downwards, and hides it ſelfe with his own leaves, and were it not that the fragrant ſmel of his many vertues diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him to the world, he would chooſe to live and die in his ſelf contenting ſecreſie.</note> they would be leſſe bitter, froward, and ſower; and they would be more gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, meek, and ſweet in their ſpirits and practiſes. Humility will make a man have high thoughts of others, and low thoughts of a mans ſelfe; it will make a man ſee much glory and excellency in others, and much baſeneſſe and ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in a mans ſelfe; it will make a man ſee others rich, and himſelf poor; others ſtrong, and himſelf weak; others wiſe, and himſelf fooliſh. Humility will make a man excellent at covering others infirmities, and at recording their gracious ſervices, and at delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="311" facs="tcp:169941:166"/> in every light that out-ſhines his owne, and in every winde that blowes others good; Humility is better at beleeving, then 'tis at queſtioning other mens hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe. I judge, ſaith an humble ſoul, 'tis well with theſe Chriſtians now, but it will be far better with them hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; they are now upon the borders of the new <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and 'twill be but as a day before they ſlide into <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> An humble ſoule is willinger to ſay, Heaven is that mans, then mine, and Chriſt is that Chriſtians, then mine, and God is their God in Covenant, then mine; ah! were Chriſtians more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, there would be leſſe fire, and more love among them then now is, &amp;c.</p>

All divine power and ſtrength againſt ſin flowes from the ſouls union<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 10. 1 Iohn 1. 6, 7.</note> and communion with Chriſt; while you keepe off from Chriſt, you keep off from that ſtrength and power which is only able to make you trample downe ſtrength, lead captivity captive, and ſlay the <hi>Goliah's</hi> that bids defiance to Chriſt.

Ah ſinner! remember this, there is no way on earth, effectually to be rid of the guilt, filth, and power of ſinne, but by believing in a Saviour.

Poor ſinners, when they are under the ſenſe of ſinne, and wrath of God, they are prone to run from creature to creature, and from duty to duty, and from Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance to Ordinance, to find reſt; and if they could finde it in any thing, or creature, Chriſt ſhould never heare of them. But here the Lord ſweetly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites them, and to encourage them, he engages himſelf to give them reſt. <hi>Come</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>and I will give you reſt.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. I anſwer, no one Scripture ſpeaks out the whole minde of Chriſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do but compare this one Scripture with thoſe ſeverall Scriptures that are laid downe in the ſecond <hi>Remedie</hi> laſt mentioned, and it will clearly appear, that though men are not thus and thus burdened and laden with their ſins, and filled with horror and terrour, if they may come to Chriſt, they may receive and embrace the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
